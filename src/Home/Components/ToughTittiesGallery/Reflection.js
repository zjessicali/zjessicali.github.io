          Through this hackathon, I was able to work with people in this field
          with different experiences and gained new understandings.
          Additionally, we worked with a mentor that taught us many things
          throughout the process, such as how to conduct research and ideate
          more creatively.

          The time constraints of a one-week project forced us to work at a
          rapid pace, limiting our time for extensive decision-making and
          experimentation. However, this taught me how to work with my team to
          quickly come to a decision together and work efficiently.
