          Through this project, I really enjoyed gaining insight into how new
          users perceive the Soju Events website, especially noticing how their
          priorities as users differ from mine as a designer. We carefully
          analyzed a wide range of observations and worked to translate them
          into concrete problems paired with feasible solutions for our client
          to implement within the project scope. Naturally, there are still many
          areas that could benefit from deeper attention, for example, the
          distracting visual inconsistencies, which led us to recommend the
          creation of a style guide. Given more time and resources, I would love
          to take on a full redesign of the website.

          The client was enthusiastic about our report, sharing that they had
          been seeking this kind of usability insight for years but didnâ€™t know
          where to begin. Shortly after, they began implementing several of our
          recommendations into their website.
