          Through this project, I learned the iterative process of constantly
          diverging and converging within a project to explore different
          directions that would ultimately lead us to our final destinationâ€”the
          finished product. In our limited time frame, I gained experience in
          working within a deadline, striking a balance between our ambitions
          and the realities of the project, and learning to discard ideas and
          elements that weren't essential. Our explorations also emphasized the
          importance of using references and inspirations from experts in the
          field, steering away from designing solely in our heads. Given
          additional time, I aim to refine certain aspects, such as intricately
          choreographing animations across pages and enhancing overall harmony
          through meticulous attention to detail.
