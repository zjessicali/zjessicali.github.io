          This fall marketing campaign involved creating an art direction that
          would encourage airport guests to reflect on life's blessings, feel
          joy, and evoke happy memories. For this project, I created postcards
          for guests to send to their loved ones around the world, 'mail' boxes
          to send the postcards, and all other assets. The installation, the
          hanging wire, the large leaf and mushroom cutouts shown in the photos,
          were made according to my art direction.
