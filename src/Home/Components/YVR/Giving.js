          In this fall marketing campaign, I created the art direction that
          would encourage airport guests to reflect on life's blessings, feel
          joy, and evoke happy memories. For this project, I created postcards
          for guests to send to their loved ones around the world, 'mailboxes'
          to send the postcards, and all other assets, excluding the
          installation. This direction tied into the whimsical feeling of fall
          and friendship, along with YVR's brand and identity as an airport.
