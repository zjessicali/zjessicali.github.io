          During my internship at YVR, I worked on a small design team of three, where I was assigned projects and tasks by the team lead. My process typically involved meeting with requesting teams to understand their goals, developing initial drafts for review and feedback, and then producing final deliverables tailored to the print shopâ€™s requirements. Below, I showcase several projects I took ownership of.
